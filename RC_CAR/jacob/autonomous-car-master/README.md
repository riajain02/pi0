This is the git repository for the autonomous car project.  Please put all
code, prototypes, and documentation here.

The current setup for the car uses a cheap RC car from amazon with the board cut out. The board was replaced with an L298N motor controller and the motors were rewired to it. The motor controller connects to the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi, giving the Pi control of the motors.
